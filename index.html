        <p>My name is Gwen Utley. I live in Guadalajara Mexico with my husband but am originally from Utah. I served a
            mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in New York City. I enjoy playing soccer,
            lifting weights, hiking, painting, and spending time with my family. I am currently studying computer
